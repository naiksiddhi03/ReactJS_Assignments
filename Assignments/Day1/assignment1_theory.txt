what are keys ?
-> used to identify which items in list are changed,updated or deleted.
   special string attribute used while creating list of elements.
   mosly recommended to use string as key so can be unique identified.
   array index can be assigned as key but problem with it is if array elements get disordered then key for elements will also change.
   If explicit keys are not assigned, React defaults to using indexes as keys.
   Keys should be unique among siblings.
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 
   let listItems = numbers.map((item,index) => 
   {
        return <li 
	    key={index}> {item} 
        </li>
    });
